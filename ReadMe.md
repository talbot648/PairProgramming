*LBBT TASK*

Context: Buying a house in UK incurs a tax which varies due to price of the house and buyer circumstances. EG: higher rate for buying second home.

Write a piece of code which given the price of a house will calculate LBBT due to be paid.

Simplicity help:
- Buyer currently already owns a property and lives in it as their main residence.
- buyer doesn't conduct any business from their house
- buyer does not own other properties
- intention of buyer is to sell their current home at the same day they buy it.

Expectations:
- Compile without error
- Have runnable Unit test
- Have those Unit tests pass
- 
TIPS: 
- keep functionality as simple as possible
- Doesn't need to cover all possible scenarios yet: if it is based off of one price range then this needs to be covered in tests
- Don't move far beyond the minimum
